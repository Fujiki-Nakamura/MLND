<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this project, I solve a problem provided by Kaggle.Kaggle is a Data Science competition platform and provide their competitors with a lot of data in real world. Many companies are working with Kaggle and sharing their data on the platform of Kaggle to discover the method that produce the best result and the talented competitors. Competitors at Kaggle make the most of their Data Analysis and Machine Learning skills and aim to win their competitions. Kaggle is also platform of learning practical skills of Data Science and helps many junior Data Scientists to advance their skills providing discussions on the forum and open scripts.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The problem I solve in this project is provided by AllState corporation, which is [the second largest personal insurer in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allstate). They provide their data including the information of how severe an insurance claim is and other information that can be useful to predict the severity. According to the Kaggle home page of this competition, they are [currently developing automated methods of predicting the cost, and hence severity, of claims](https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity)  and looking for the talented competitors to recruit.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The objective for this project is not recruitment, but through this problem I provide a case study of developing automated methods to produce good predictions.

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is a problem of regression because the target value (, which is the severity here) is numerical and a problem of supervised learning because the target value is explicitly provided in the training dataset and we have to predict the scores for the test dataset. In such a kind of problem, I need to build the model which predicts the cost of claims that Allstate's customers have to pay as correctly as possible. In order to achive that goal, I follow the strategy outlined below:

<ol type="1">
  <li>
    Data Exploration:
    </br>explore the data and grasp how it looks like. In this process, I examine the meanings and distibutions of the data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Data Preprocessing:
    </br>preprocess the data in a way the each model built later can handle them appropriately. Convert some type of values into another type of values to feed them into the models appropriately, transform some values to correct their skewness in distributions and remove some unnecessary values.
  </li>
  <li>
    Building Machine Learning models:
    </br>Develop several Machine Learning models to approach the solution. Build the baseline models and define their performance as the criteria of improvement later.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tuning the models:
    </br>
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensembling the models:
    </br>To achive better performance than single model,
  </li>
</ol>
